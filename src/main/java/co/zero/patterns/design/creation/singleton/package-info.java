/**
 * This package contains an implementation of Singleton pattern
 * 
 * <p>The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance per JVM,
 * and provides a global point of access to it. However, although the 
 * Singleton is the simplest in terms of its class diagram because there 
 * is only one single class, its implementation is a bit trickier.</p>
